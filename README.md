# An√°lise de Sentimentos com Language Studio no Azure AI

## DIO challenge for the Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals certification.

In this exercise, I used the tools available at the [Azure Language Studio](https://language.cognitive.azure.com/tryout/sentiment) and the [Azure Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/b82f659a5f9c4e399f59fe9a069ae4a1/speechtotexttool) to try the AI Services and evaluate a machine learning model.

It's the same example used in the web class of the [course](https://web.dio.me/track/microsoft-azure-ai-fundamentals).
